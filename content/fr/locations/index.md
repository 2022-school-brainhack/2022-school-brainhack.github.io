### BrainHack school brings together the best of neuroimaging in Montreal.

The Brainhack school is organized at five different institutions (see below). The school will run from Monday to Friday for 5 weeks. The school will be open each day from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., with a lunch break from 12 am to 1 pm. Registration is free for participants enrolled in one of the four partner institutions, and **50$ CAD** otherwise. Please contact [Claude Godbout](mailto:claude.godbout@criugm.qc.ca) for any question.

Graduate students (Master and PhD) at the psychology department of Université de Montréal can register to brainhack school as a 3 credit course called ["PSY 6983 - Projet en sciences des données neuronales"](https://admission.umontreal.ca/cours-et-horaires/cours/psy-6983/). Graduate students at École Polytechnique, Concordia University and McGill University can register to PSY 6983 through the [Bureau de coopération inter-universitaire](http://www.bci-qc.ca/). Participants from outside of the partner institutions can register too. Computer Science students from Concordia University can also register through a COMP 490 or COMP 6971 project, following the usual procedure in their department.
