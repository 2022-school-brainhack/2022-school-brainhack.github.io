You can also help improve the template by posting an issue on the [template repo](https://github.com/brainhack-school2020/project_template/issues). Project repositories are hosted in the Brainhack school 2020 [github organization](https://github.com/brainhack-school2020).

# Adding your project to the gallery

The gallery can be found [here](project). Instructions to push your project to this gallery through a pull request to the [BHS website](https://github.com/brainhackmtl/school) are coming soon...

# Project evaluation

You will have to present your project to the class during week 4, and finalize the deliverables of your project. Both the presentation and the written deliverables will be evaluated with the following criteria, using a 3-level scale:

* 1: does not meet expectations
* 2: partially meets expectations
* 3: totally meets expectations

Grades will be given by several instructors and averaged to obtain the
final presentation grade.

## Use of open-science best practices (1-3)

Expectation: the project uses 3 open-science tools learnt during week 1, or
provides a convincing reason to not use them. The 3 tools may be selected
in the following list, but other relevant tools will be accepted too.

* Git
* GitHub

* Python
* BIDS
* Jupyter notebooks
* Binder

## Skills and technologies learnt (1-3)

Expectation: the project uses 1 skill, method or technology learnt by the
student during the school, through formal presentations or informal
interactions. The skill, method or technology may be selected in the following list,
but other relevant ones will be accepted too.

* Machine learning
* Multivariate statistics and matrix factorizations
* Estimation of connectivity
* High-performance computing
* DataLad

## Project relevance (1-3)

Expectation: the project is relevant to brain data analysis.

## Clarity (1-3)

Expectation: the presentation is easy to follow, and supported by
convincing material (e.g., slides).

## Bonuses

* Highly reproducible project (0-1)
* Technological achievement (0-1)
* Exciting presentation (0-1)
