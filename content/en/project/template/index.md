summary: "This tutorial will show you how to create your project page. At the end of the tutorial, you will have used mainly GitHub, Markdown formatting, and probably your terminal. You don't have to install the software (HUGO) to generate the website locally, but if you are curious to render the site and play with it to see how your page would look like, we also included the instruction."
