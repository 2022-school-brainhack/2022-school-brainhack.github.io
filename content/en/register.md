Graduate students (Master and PhD) at the psychology department of Université de Montréal can register to brainhack school as a 3 credit course called "[PSY 6983 - Projet en sciences des données neuronales](https://admission.umontreal.ca/cours-et-horaires/cours/psy-6983/)" . Graduate students at École Polytechnique, Concordia University and McGill University can register to PSY 6983 through the [Bureau de coopération inter-universitaire](https://admission.umontreal.ca/cours-et-horaires/cours/psy-6983/). Participants from outside of the partner institutions can register too. Computer Science students from Concordia University can also register through a [COMP 490](http://www.concordia.ca/academics/undergraduate/calendar/current/sec71/71-70.html) or COMP 6971 project, following the usual procedure in their department.
