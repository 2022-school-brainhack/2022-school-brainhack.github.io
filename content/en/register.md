The BrainHack School is open in priority to students registered at one of the four partner institutions. However, **a quota of participants will be selected from outside of these universities, and possibly from outside of Canada**. The selection of students is based on the following criteria:

  * ensuring a good diversity and complementarity of backgrounds across participants,
  * assessing whether participants will benefit from attending the school,
  * a lottery, if necessary.

The BrainHack school can be recognized for up to 6 credits. The way these credits get recognized, as well as the eligibility will vary across institutions. **Please apply for brainhack school with the form below and wait for confirmation of acceptance before registering through your university portal**.

 * Graduate students (Master and PhD) at the psychology department of Université de Montréal can register to brainhack school as a 3 credit course called "[PSY 6983 - Projet en sciences des données neuronales](https://admission.umontreal.ca/cours-et-horaires/cours/psy-6983/)".
 * Graduate students (Master and PhD) at the Quantitative Life Science program of McGill University can register to the first week of BrainHack School as a 3 credit course called ["QLSC 612 - Fundamentals for Neuro Data Science"](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2019-2020/courses/qlsc-612).
 * Computer Science students from Concordia University can also register through a [COMP 490](http://www.concordia.ca/academics/undergraduate/calendar/current/sec71/71-70.html), for 3 credits, or COMP 6971 project.
 * Students from Polytechnique (or any Quebec university) can register to the course above through the [Bureau de coopération inter-universitaire](http://www.bci-qc.ca/en/), provided that their program allows for credits taken outside of their program.
 * Students from outside the Quebec province are not eligible for credits, unless specific opportunities exist for recognizing summer schools at their home institution.   

Note that it is possible to register both to QLSC612 (which is the first week bootcamp), and either PSY6983 or COMP490/COMP6971 (for the project part of BrainHack), for a maximum total of 6 credits for BrainHack School. It is not possible to register simultaneously to PSY6983 and COMP490/COMP6971.
