The BrainHack School is open in priority to students registered at one of the four partner institutions. However, **a quota of participants will be selected from outside of these universities, and possibly from outside of Canada**. The selection of students is based on the following criteria:

  * ensuring a good diversity and complementarity of backgrounds across participants,
  * assessing whether participants will benefit from attending the school,
  * a lottery, if necessary.

The BrainHack school can be recognized for up to 6 credits, for the full 4 weeks. The way these credits get recognized, as well as the eligibility will vary across institutions. **Please apply for brainhack school with the form below and wait for confirmation of acceptance before registering through your university portal**.

 * Graduate students (Master and PhD) at the psychology department of Université de Montréal can register to brainhack school as a 3 credit course called "[PSY 6983 - Projet en sciences des données neuronales](https://admission.umontreal.ca/cours-et-horaires/cours/psy-6983/)".
 * Graduate students (Master and PhD) at the Quantitative Life Science program of McGill University can register to the first week of BrainHack School as a 3 credit course called ["QLSC 612 - Fundamentals for Neuro Data Science"](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2019-2020/courses/qlsc-612).
 * Computer Science students from Concordia University can also register through a [COMP 490](http://www.concordia.ca/academics/undergraduate/calendar/current/sec71/71-70.html), for 3 credits, or COMP 6971 project, following the usual procedure in their department.

 It is possible to register between universities through the [Bureau de coopération inter-universitaire](http://www.bci-qc.ca/en/), provided that the program a student is registered to allows for credits taken outside of their program. This possibility applies to any Quebec students, and is not limited to the four partner universities. Students from outside the Quebec province are not eligible for credits, unless specific opportunities exist for recognizing summer schools at their home institution.
