        During office hours the listed instructor will be active and on-line in the Slack #help-installation channel.


        If you experience any issues or have any questions while following the **[installation instructions](https://neurodatasci-course-2020.netlify.app/setup/)**
        you can ping them in the [#help-installation channel](https://brainhack-school2020.slack.com/archives/C0121EXGHP1) and they will follow up with you.
        If needed, they will also be available to jump on a Zoom call to debug any issues you may be experiencing (this will potentially require you
        to permit them remote access to your computer).


        Note you are more than welcome to post questions to the #help-installation channel during times when no instructor
        is listed as being available, but it may take more time to receive a response!"
